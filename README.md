# Federated Learning for Abstractive Text Summarization: Experimental Results

## 1. Abstract
This report presents a comprehensive evaluation of Federated Learning (FL) for abstractive text summarization using the DistilBART model on the CNN/DailyMail dataset. We investigate the impact of varying numbers of clients (2-10) on model performance, with a focus on text generation quality and client contribution patterns.

## 2. Introduction
Federated Learning enables collaborative model training across decentralized devices while preserving data privacy. This experiment explores FL's effectiveness for abstractive summarization, a challenging NLP task that requires understanding and generating coherent text. We analyze how different client configurations affect model performance and training dynamics.

## 3. Related Work
Our approach builds upon recent advances in:
- Transformer-based sequence-to-sequence models (Vaswani et al., 2017)
- Federated Learning optimization (McMahan et al., 2017)

  - 2 clients: 0.0 (equal contribution)
  - 10 clients: ~0.013 (slight variation in contributions)
- **Coefficient of Variation (CV)**: Consistently below 0.06
  - Indicates highly balanced client participation
  - Ranged from 0.0 (2 clients) to 0.058 (7 clients)
- **Average Contribution per Client**:
  - Decreased with increasing number of clients (as expected)
  - From ~146.7 (2 clients) to ~60.2 (10 clients)

### 5.3 Key Observations

#### 5.3.1 Optimal Client Count
- The 6-client configuration consistently performed best across multiple metrics
- Performance plateaued beyond 6 clients, suggesting diminishing returns
- This indicates an optimal balance between model diversity and update quality

#### 5.3.2 Training Stability
- Lower client counts (2-4) showed more variance in performance
- Higher client counts (8-10) showed more stable but slightly lower performance
- The 6-client configuration achieved the best balance between stability and performance

### 5.4 Discussion

The results demonstrate that federated learning can effectively train abstractive summarization models while maintaining data privacy. The near-optimal performance with 6 clients suggests that:

1. **Data Distribution**: The non-IID partitioning based on publication date provides sufficient diversity without excessive fragmentation
2. **Update Quality**: The aggregation mechanism effectively combines updates from multiple clients
3. **Convergence**: The model converges reliably across different client configurations

### 5.5 Limitations

1. **Client Count**: Limited to 2-10 clients in this study
2. **Dataset**: Only evaluated on CNN/DailyMail
3. **Computation**: Training was not distributed across physical devices

## üìä Metrics Explanation

### Text Generation Metrics

#### ROUGE (Recall-Oriented Understudy for Gisting Evaluation)
- **ROUGE-1**: Measures unigram (single word) overlap between generated and reference summaries
- **ROUGE-2**: Measures bigram overlap between generated and reference summaries
- **ROUGE-L**: Measures the longest common subsequence between generated and reference summaries
  - Higher ROUGE scores (0-100 scale) indicate better summary quality

#### BLEU (Bilingual Evaluation Understudy)
- **BLEU-1 to BLEU-4**: Measures n-gram precision between generated and reference summaries
  - BLEU-1: Unigram precision
  - BLEU-2: Bigram precision
  - BLEU-3: Trigram precision
  - BLEU-4: 4-gram precision
  - Higher BLEU scores (0-100 scale) indicate better n-gram matching

#### BERTScore
- **BERTScore F1**: Measures semantic similarity between generated and reference texts using contextual embeddings
  - Values closer to 100 indicate better semantic similarity
  - More robust to paraphrasing than n-gram based metrics

### Training Metrics
- **Loss**: Cross-entropy loss during training
  - Lower values indicate better model fitting
  - Should generally decrease and stabilize over training rounds

### Federated Learning Metrics
- **Gini Coefficient**: Measures inequality in client contributions
  - 0 = perfect equality, 1 = maximum inequality
- **CV (Coefficient of Variation)**: Measures relative variability in client contributions
  - Lower values indicate more balanced participation
- **Mean/Min/Max Contribution**: Statistics about client participation

## üõ†Ô∏è Configuration Options

  max_target_length: 142
  
model:
  model_name: "facebook/bart-large-cnn"
  learning_rate: 5e-5
  weight_decay: 0.01
  
federated:
  num_clients: 5
  clients_per_round: 3

```

## üìà Analysis and Interpretation

### Configuration Analysis

1. **Optimal Client Count**
   - Run the configuration analysis tool to identify the best performing setup:
   ```bash
   python -m src.visualization.analyze_config_performance \
       --metrics-file ./experiment_results/analysis/consolidated_metrics.csv \
       --output-dir ./experiment_results/analysis/plots
   ```
   - Look for the "elbow point" in the performance curves where adding more clients yields diminishing returns
   - Balance between model performance and computational resources

2. **Performance Trends**
   - Check if ROUGE-L and BERTScore improve with more clients
   - Look for consistent patterns across different metrics

2. **Model Stability**
   - Consistent performance across different client counts indicates robust learning
   - Large fluctuations in metrics might suggest unstable training

3. **Client Contribution**
   - Balanced Gini coefficient (closer to 0) indicates fair client participation
   - High CV might suggest some clients are contributing more than others

Edit `configs/bart_cnndm.yaml` to customize:

```yaml
training:
  num_rounds: 10
  clients_per_round: 3
  batch_size: 8
  learning_rate: 5e-5
  max_seq_length: 1024
  max_target_length: 142

data:
  train_split: "train"
  val_split: "validation"
  test_split: "test"
  max_samples: null  # Set to number for debugging
```
